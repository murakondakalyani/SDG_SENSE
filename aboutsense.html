      <h2>About Our Project</h2>
  
      <p>
        Children, especially in schools are often referred to as future leaders have a significant role in the attainment of SDGs as the changes in their behaviour can contribute to a sustainable future. To create awareness among the students, schools are uniquely positioned to introduce students about the SDGs. However, there is a large gap in integrating the SDG education into the existing curriculum in the schools due to lack of resources, tools, and strategies to effectively teach students about these goals. School children often come across the terms “sustainability” and climate change but struggle to understand the relevance of these terms in their real-life lives. Lack of structured learning tools that are simple, interactive, and engaging will impede the understanding of SDGs among school children. Without interactive tools or hands-on learning experiences, SDGs can feel abstract or irrelevant to young learners, especially to understand the applicability of these principles in their daily lives, further limiting their understanding and engagement. To address these challenges, the SENSE (School Engagement for Nurturing SDG Education) project aims to close the gap between global sustainability goals and young learners. By creating interactive tools and engaging material, SENSE seeks to make SDG education accessible, practical, and engaging for the next generation.</p>
      <p>
        Through this project SENSE, (i) we aim to improve the awareness of SDGs among school children (ii) Develop accessible, interactive, and engaging resources for understanding SDGs (iii) instil behavioural habits that align with sustainable development goals.

 

We believe this project will have a ripple effect as educating school children will share with the peers and families resulting in the influence of a broader audience. By nurturing awareness and action at an early age, the project contributes to a generation of informed, responsible citizens. </p>
